# Registra Domini üß†üíª

A **university exam project** focused on understanding and implementing the **core principles of backend system design** ‚Äî from the logic and data storage layer to a functional frontend interface.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of **Registra Domini** is to **design and build a complete backend system from scratch**, without relying on external database engines or ORM frameworks.  
The project simulates the process of building an entire data-driven web application ‚Äî from low-level storage logic to user interaction ‚Äî in order to fully understand how backend architectures work internally.

## üß© What‚Äôs Inside

### 1. **Custom Database Engine**
- Implemented **from zero**, without using any SQL or NoSQL database system.  
- Includes a **custom data storage layer**, capable of handling tables, records, and indexing.
- Features a **homemade query language**, designed to resemble simplified SQL syntax.

### 2. **Backend Logic**
- Built around RESTful design principles.  
- Provides endpoints to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete data.
  - Handle authentication and user session management.
  - Execute queries against the custom database.

### 3. **Frontend Interface**
- A simple web interface that allows users to:
  - Create and manage their own profiles.
  - Perform basic operations on the database (insert, query, modify data).
  - Interact with the backend through the RESTful API.

## üß™ Learning Focus

This project was developed as part of a **university examination in computer science / IT engineering**, aimed at testing understanding of:

- Backend architecture design
- Custom database implementation
- Query language design
- RESTful API design
- Frontend-backend integration

The intention is **not** to produce a production-ready system, but to **demonstrate full-stack system design knowledge** and **low-level understanding of database management concepts**.
